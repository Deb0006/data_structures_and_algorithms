Python Data Structures and Algorithms
================================

This repository contains various Python implementations of common data structures and algorithms. These were created as practice exercises to reinforce my understanding of these concepts.

The following algorithms are implemented in this repository:


Search Algorithms
------------------
* Binary Search
* Binary Search with Recursion
* Linear Search

Sorting Algorithms
------------------
* Bubble Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort

Other Algorithms
------------------
* Factorial
* Factorial with Recursion
* Fibonacci
* Fibonacci with Recursion
* Power of Two
* Prime Number Generation

Installation
------------------
To use the code in this repository, you must have Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download Python 3 from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

After installing Python 3, follow these steps to clone the repository on your local machine:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt window.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
3. Type the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Deb0006/data_structures_and_algorithms.git
```
4. Press Enter to clone the repository.

Usage
------------------
Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the directory where it is located and open the files in your preferred Python editor or IDE. You can run each file individually to see the implementation of the search or sorting algorithm.
